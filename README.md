Evaluate the toxicity of players
My project aims, by using chat logs from real life games, to determine how emotions/emotive language in text communication can 
help or hinder the outcome of a game or performance of an individual. By using sentiment analysis, with a definitive focus on 
negativity, I intend to provide an overall score of performance given a level of toxicity. This will be done by developing an 
algorithm which evaluates the end result of a game, an individual's performance and the communication used in that game to 
give the overall impact it has. This is then displayed for users to see visually and with clarity.
